## About
This is a template file for Obsidian - Zotero research writing workflows. Built off [Alexandra Phelan's setup](https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-56bf918d51ab), we have modified her efforts to streamline compatibility with Zotero Integration (Obsidian Zotero Desktop Connector). 

Please feel free to borrow these ideas or templates for your own use.
